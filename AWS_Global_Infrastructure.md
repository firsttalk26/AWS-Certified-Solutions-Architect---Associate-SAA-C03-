# AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS offers a larger connected secured infrastructure that offers multiple Regions that contain at least 3 Availability zones to serve approximately 200 service to customers globally.

# AWS Global Infrastructure offers below benefits to customers

##  Security

AWS offers tight security with its global infrastructure; all data flowing across the AWS global network interconnects datacenters (Availability zones) and regions is automatically encrypted at the physical layer.

## Availability

AWS offers a group of physically separate and independent data centers(Availability Zones) which helps to enable high availability and fault tolerance for applications built across multiple AZs. 

Availability zone(AZ) is the collection of data centers.

A group of AZs are Regions offered by AWS which is isolated and independent of each other. Any fault in regional service in one region does not affect other regions.

A region consists of at least three availability zones.

**AWS Control Plane** and **AWS Console Management** helps in maintaining high availability.

## Performance

The AWS Global Infrastructure is built for performance. AWS Regions offer low latency, low packet loss, and high overall network quality.   
This is achieved with a fully redundant 400 GbE fiber network backbone, often providing many terabits of capacity between Regions.   
**AWS Local Zones and AWS Wavelength**.

## Scalability

AWS Global Infrastructure enables customers to scale the resources as per requirements in peak hour or based on customer geolocation in different regions.

## Flexibility

The AWS Global Infrastructure gives you the flexibility of choosing how and where you want to run your workloads, and when you do you are using the same network, control plane, APIâ€™s, and AWS services. 

* If you would like to run your applications globally you can choose from any of the AWS Regions and AZs.   
* If you need to run your applications with single-digit millisecond latencies to mobile devices and end-users you can choose [AWS Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/) or [AWS Wavelength](https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/).   
* If you would like to run your applications on-premises you can choose [AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/).

## Global Footprint

AWS has the largest global infrastructure and provides different data centers across the globe which enables customers to deploy applications nearest to customer geolocation which helps to reduce the latency.

If your data lives off this planet, you can use AWS Ground Station, which provides satellite antennas in close proximity to AWS infrastructure Regions.
